# 🚀 Challenge-market-blitz / Bruno Assis Siqueira

## Challenge objective
A technical challenge was proposed in which I received a code snippet and was challenged to find possible errors in the code and correct them. Syntax and writing errors were found, mainly in the selectors, for example in the case of getByText('Yes, Delete Account') which was missing the word “My”.
I took the liberty of leaving the code in the Page Objects template, since the code was only in one file, making it more difficult to read.
